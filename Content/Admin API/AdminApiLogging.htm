        <h1>Admin API Logging</h1>
        <p>Admin API transactions are logged in the Admin Service application log, for which the default location is <code>/var/log/cloudian/cloudian-admin.log</code>. API transactions are logged at log level INFO. As with all Admin Service application log entries, the format for API transaction entries is:</p><pre>Date(ISO8601) PriorityLevel [ThreadId] ClassName:MethodName(Line#) MESSAGE</pre>
        <p>In the following example, first a request to retrieve the current list of user groups in the system is successfully processed. Then a request is received which is asking to retrieve a specific group that doesn’t actually exist in the system (perhaps the requestor made a typo in the group ID). That request results in a 204 HTTP error response from the system. Note that each API transaction is identified by an integer within the MESSAGE element — "7" for the first transaction in the example and "8" for the second transaction.</p><pre xml:space="preserve">2016-01-02 09:45:07,841  INFO [qtp21028611-57] LoggingFilter:log(153) 7 * Server has received
