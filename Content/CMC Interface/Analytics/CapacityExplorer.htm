        <p>Path: <b>Analytics → Capacity Explorer</b></p>
        <p>Supported task:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>View available capacity by region, data center, and node</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With the CMC's <b>Capacity Explorer</b> page you can view your available system capacity, starting with total regional cluster capacity (on the left), then moving to more granular break-downs of available capacity per data center and per individual node. In each case the display text indicates the total capacity designated for HyperStore data storage and the remaining free space. For example, if for a particular node the display indicates "92.2 GB, 81.6 GB free", then means that of 92.2GB of total disk space allocated for HyperStore data storage on that node, 81.6GB is currently free.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note &#160;&lt;/b&gt;">This statistic calculates disk usage in a way that counts a disk’s "reserved-blocks-percentage" (the portion of the disk space that’s reserved for privileged processes) as used space. By default in Linux systems the configurable "reserved-blocks-percentage" for a file system is 5% of disk capacity. With HyperStore Appliance machines, the reserved space is set to 0 so that all capacity is available for HyperStore data storage.</p>
        <p>The vertical bands that indicate capacity usage for region, data center, and nodes are color-coded to highlight the degree of usage:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="color: #ff4500;">Red</span> — more than 90% of capacity is used.</li>
            <li><span style="color: #ffa07a;">Orange</span> — between 71% and 90% of capacity is used.</li>
            <li><span style="color: #32cd32;">Green</span> — 70% or less of capacity is used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Clicking on the color-coded part of a node’s capacity band takes you to the <MadCap:xref href="../Cluster/Node Status/NodeStatusOverview.htm">Node Status</MadCap:xref> page for that node.</p>
