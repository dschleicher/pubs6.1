        <p>The lower section of the CMC's <b>Repair Status</b> page displays a color-coded node icon (cube) for each node in the cluster. The color-coding legend is indicated in the interface, with each node icon shown in a distinct color depending on which of these repair statuses applies to the node:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Repair is Required</em> — The node is in need of proactive repair (meaning that there is a queue of object replicas or erasure coded fragments that is known to be missing from the node, typically as a result of the node having been temporarily offline). Proactive repair will automatically occur at the next proactive repair interval (by default every 60 minutes).</li>
            <li><em>Proactive Rebuild</em> — Proactive repair is in progress on the node.</li>
            <li><em>Data Rebalancing</em> — Data rebalancing (an operator-initiated<em> repair</em>, <em>repairec</em>, <em>decommision</em>, or <em>removenode</em> operation) is in progress for the node.</li>
            <li><em>Data Integrity Check</em> — A repair using "computedigest" is in progress on the node.</li>
            <li><em>All Clear</em> — No repair of any type is in progress on the node, and the node is not currently in need of proactive repair.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note &#160;&lt;/b&gt;">In the event that multiple repair types are simultaneously running on the node, the color-coding reflects whichever repair type started first on the node.<br /><br />If the HyperStore Service is down on a node, the node icon displays as bright red.</p>
        <p>If you click a node icon, information about in-progress and recently completed repairs on that node will display.</p>

        <p>This is the same information that is retrieved when you run the <em>opstatus</em> command on a node. For description of the available information items see the <a href="../../../Commands/hsstool/hsstoolOpstatus.htm/#Command/" target="_popup">Response section of the hsstool opstatus documentation</a>. If you click the host name at the top of the status information display you will jump to the <MadCap:xref href="../../Cluster/Node Status/NodeStatusOverview.htm">Node Status</MadCap:xref> page for that node.</p>
