        <h1>Configure a Bucket Lifecycle Policy for Object Auto-Tiering or Expiration</h1>
        <p class="TopicTag" MadCap:conditions="General.Online">[CMC Interface]</p>
        <p>The HyperStore system supports configuring bucket lifecycle policies so that objects are automatically deleted on a defined schedule. The system also supports auto-tiering, whereby objects in a bucket are automatically moved to a different storage system on a defined schedule. For more information on the auto-tiering feature see <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Major Features/Auto-Tiering/AutoTieringOverview.htm" target="_popup">Auto-Tiering Feature Overview</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note &#160;&lt;/b&gt;">By default the auto-tiering function is disabled. If you want to enable this function, go to the CMC's <b>Configuration Settings</b> page where you can turn on the <MadCap:xref href="../../../Cluster/Configuration Settings/ConfigurationSettingsAutoTiering.htm#Enable_Auto_Tiering" target="_popup">Enable Auto Tiering</MadCap:xref> setting and set an <MadCap:xref href="../../../Cluster/Configuration Settings/ConfigurationSettingsAutoTiering.htm#Auto_Tiering_URL" target="_popup">Auto Tiering URL</MadCap:xref>.<br /><br />Note that even if object auto-tiering is disabled, you can still configure a bucket lifecycle for object expiration.</p>
        <p>To configure auto-tiering or auto-expiration for a bucket, select the <b>Lifecycle Policy</b> tab of the CMC's bucket properties interface.</p>

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Specify the "Object Prefix" of the objects for which you you want to create a lifecycle policy. The path should start from the root level of your bucket, and you do not need to include a leading forward slash ("/"). You should however include a trailing forward slash to demarcate the "folder" name from its contents (which will be subject to the lifecycle policy that you’re configuring). Examples of proper object prefixes:</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="Indent">
            <ul>
                <li><em>Documents/</em>
                </li>
                <li><em>Logs/rolled/</em>
                </li>
                <li><em>Projects/archived/2014/</em>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>To have the lifecycle policy apply to all objects in the bucket, leave the "Object Prefix" field empty.</p>
        </div>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>If desired, create an <b>auto-tiering schedule</b>. Your options will depend on HyperStore service configuration. If auto-tiering is not enabled in your service, no auto-tiering option will display in the Lifecycle Policy interface. If auto-tiering is supported in your service, you can select the "Enable Tiering" checkbox to display the auto-tiering scheduling options.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="Indent">

            </p>
            <p>Then do the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose a tiering destination system. Your options will be "Tier to AWS S3", "Tier to AWS Glacier", and/or "Tier to Cloudian S3", depending on service configuration.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="NoteIndent" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">When transitioned objects are stored in Amazon S3 or Amazon Glacier you will incur separate storage fees as per the terms of your service agreement.<br /><br />You cannot change the destination system later. For example, once a bucket is set up for tiering to Amazon S3 or to Glacier, you cannot switch it from one to the other.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Specify a schedule for transitioning objects. You have three alternatives for scheduling object transition:</li>

If you are using the CMC as your S3 client, and you try to download an auto-tiered object from a bucket configured for the "Redirect" method of handling GETs, the CMC will return an error response and indicate that the only supported method for retrieving the object is to restore it.</p>

                        <p>If you choose this option, the only way that S3 client applications will be allowed to access tiered objects is to execute a <MadCap:xref href="../../../../S3 API Support/OperationsObjects/PostObjectRestore.htm" target="_popup">POST Object restore</MadCap:xref> request in order to temporarily restore a copy of the object in local HyperStore storage. For information about how this works in the CMC’s <b>Objects</b> interface, see <MadCap:xref href="../../Objects/ObjectRestore.htm" target="_popup">Restore an Auto-Tiered File</MadCap:xref>.</p>
                        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note &#160;&lt;/b&gt;">For objects tiered to Glacier, this is the only supported object retrieval method.</p>

Doing so will display "Access Key" and "Secret Key" fields in which you can enter your own access key and secret key. The system will then use these account credentials when it transitions objects from the bucket to the destination account.</p>
                        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note &#160;&lt;/b&gt;">The system does not validate your credentials when you enter them in the <b>Lifecycle Policy</b> dialog. If you supply invalid credentials, subsequent auto-tiering operations for your bucket will fail. <br /><br />The system will create a tiering bucket under the chosen destination account (either the system default account or the account associated with the supplied access key and secret key). Objects will be auto-tiered into this bucket. The bucket will be named as: <br /><br /><em>&lt;origin-bucket-name-truncated-to-34-characters&gt;.&lt;random-string&gt;</em></p>

                <li>Calendar date on which to expire objects.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note &#160;&lt;/b&gt;">A bucket lifecycle rule can consist of an auto-tiering rule, or an expiration rule, or both an auto-tiering rule and an expiration rule. In the latter case, be sure to configure the schedules so that the auto-tiering occurs first, and then subsequently the expiration/deletion of auto-tiered objects in the destination system.</p>

            <li>Click <b>Save</b>.</li>

        <p>Once a lifecycle policy is created for a bucket, you can subsequently edit the policy by making your desired changes in the <b>Lifecycle Policy</b> interface and then clicking <b>Save</b>.</p>
        <p>Likewise you can disable a lifecycle policy — either the auto-tiering element, or the object expiration element, or both — by unchecking the "Enable Tiering" and/or "Expire Objects" checkboxes and then clicking <b>Save</b>.</p>
        <p>Note that changing or disabling a lifecycle policy changes the behavior of the bucket from that point forward — it doesn’t change the past behavior. So for example, if you disable an auto-tiering schedule that had been in place for your bucket, any objects that have already been transitioned to a tiering destination system will remain in that system.</p>
        <p>Note also that the CMC permits you to configure only <b>one lifecycle policy per bucket</b>. While the S3 API (for both Amazon and Cloudian HyperStore) permits the creation of different lifecycle policies for different object prefixes within the same bucket, the CMC does not currently support this functionality.</p>
