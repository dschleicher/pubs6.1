        <h1>Create or Delete a "Folder"</h1>
        <p class="TopicTag" MadCap:conditions="Cloudian.HelpSysAdminOnly">[CMC Interface]</p>
        <p>In an S3-based storage system, each data entity stored in a bucket is known as an "object". Each object has its own unique URI — derived from the object name — that S3 applications use when retrieving the object. An S3 storage system does not have a hierarchical structure like a conventional file system. However, objects can be named in such a way as to imply a hierarchy. For example, in a bucket there could be four objects named:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Documents/resume.docx</em>
            </li>
            <li><em>Documents/schedule.docx</em>
            </li>
            <li><em>Images/birthday-party.png</em>
            </li>
            <li><em>Images/sunset.png</em>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The CMC makes it easy to create such hierarchies by enabling you to create "folders". To arrive at the example above, through the CMC interface you could create a folder named "Documents", and then drill down into that folder and upload files named "resume.docx" and "schedule.docx". Behind the scenes, in the S3 storage layer, objects named "Documents/resume.docx" and "Documents/schedule.docx" are created. In the CMC interface, you can then retrieve a list of the contents of the "Documents" folder: the display will list the "resume.docx" and "schedule.docx" files.</p>
        <p>Thus while the back-end is implemented differently, the CMC user experience is just like interacting with a regular file system.</p>
        <p><b>To create a folder:</b>
        </p>
        <p>In the <b>Buckets</b> list view, click the name of the bucket that you want to work with. This will display the <b>Objects</b> view for that bucket. (Alternatively you can click the <b>Objects</b> tab and then choose a bucket from drop-down list.)</p>
        <p>At the bottom of the <b>Objects</b> interface, enter the folder name and then click <b>Create Folder</b>. The new folder will then display in the object list view.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note &#160;&lt;/b&gt;">For folder naming restrictions, see <MadCap:xref href="ObjectNameRestrictions.htm" target="_popup">Object Naming Restrictions</MadCap:xref>. These restrictions apply to unusual naming schemes and are of no concern if you are using a simple alphanumeric folder name.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note &#160;&lt;/b&gt;">The CMC does not support renaming existing folders.</p>
        <p><b>To delete a folder:</b>
        </p>
        <p>To delete a folder click <b>Delete</b> at the right side of the folder’s display row. You will be asked to confirm that you want to delete the folder.</p>
        <p class="Important" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;IMPORTANT: &lt;/b&gt;">Deleting a folder will also delete all files and sub-folders within the folder.</p>
