                <p>By default, this threshold is set to 0 so that all S3 objects are stored in the Linux file system, and none are stored in Cassandra. With this approach, Cassandra is used exclusively for storing various types of metadata.

                <p>The type of compression to use for S3 objects stored in the HyperStore file system. This applies to replicated S3 object data and erasure coded S3 object data stored in the HyperStore file system. It does not apply to data stored in Cassandra.</p>
                <p>Supported options are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://google.github.io/snappy/" target="_blank">Snappy</a>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="http://zlib.net/" target="_blank">Zlib</a>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/Cyan4973/lz4" target="_blank">LZ4</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>None (no compression)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When enabled, compression is applied to incoming S3 objects by the S3 Service, before those objects are transmitted to the HyperStore Service and placed into storage. Any change that you make to the HyperStore Compression Type — such as changing it from disabled to a particular compression type, or from one compression type to another — is applied only to new S3 objects as they come into the system, not retroactively to objects that are already stored in the system.</p>
                <p>Each object’s compression type (if any) is stored in the object’s metadata in Cassandra. Consequently, if for example you use Snappy for a while and then switch to LZ4, those objects that had been compressed with Snappy will continue to have in their metadata an indicator that they were compressed with Snappy — and so the system will be able to de-compress the objects when they are downloaded by S3 client applications.</p>
                <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note &#160;&lt;/b&gt;">For S3 service usage tracking (for purposes of QoS enforcement and billing), the <b>uncompressed</b> size of objects is always used, even if you enable HyperStore compression.<br /><br />For a <MadCap:xref href="../../../S3 API Support/OperationsObjects/PutObjectCopy.htm" target="_popup">PUT Object - Copy</MadCap:xref> operation, the copy of the object will be subject to whatever the <b>current</b> HyperStore Compression Type setting is (which may be different than the setting that was in effect when the original object was uploaded).</p>

                <p>For large objects that are subject to a replication storage policy, as a performance optimization the HyperStore system breaks the objects into multiple chunks before replicating and storing them. This property sets the maximum size of a single chunk, in bytes. If an uploaded object subject to replication is larger than this, the system will first divide the object data into chunks. Each chunk will then be replicated in accordance with the storage policy that applies to that object.</p>
                <p>For example, suppose that the configured chunk size is 10MB, and that a 25MB object is uploaded to a bucket that uses 3X replication. The system will first divide the object data into three chunks of size 10MB, 10MB, and 5MB, and each of those chunks will then be replicated three times. For each chunk, its three replicas will each be stored on a different node so as to safeguard the chunk’s durability and availability.</p>
                <p>On reads, the system reassembles the object from its chunks.</p>

                <p>For large objects that are subject to an erasure coding storage policy, as a performance optimization the HyperStore system breaks the objects into multiple chunks before erasure coding and storing them. This property sets the maximum size of a single chunk, in bytes. If an uploaded object subject to erasure coding is larger than this, the system will first divide the object data into chunks. Each chunk will then be erasure coded in accordance with the storage policy that applies to that object.</p>
                <p>For example, suppose that the configured chunk size is 40MB, and that a 100MB object is uploaded to a bucket that uses 4+2 erasure coding. The system will first divide the object data into three chunks of size 40MB, 40MB, and 20MB. Each of those chunks will then be subjected to 4+2 erasure coding. For example the first 40MB chunk will be erasure coded into six 10MB fragments, each of which will be stored on a different node.</p>
                <p>On reads, the system decodes each chunk from its fragments and then reassembles the object from its chunks.</p>

                <p>The automated action for the system to take in the event that read or write errors occur for a particular HyperStore data disk. Supported automated actions are:</p>

                    <li><b>Disable Disk and Move its Tokens</b> — With this setting, if disk errors are detected the system will automatically unmount the disk and mark it as disabled. The system will also automatically transfer the disabled disk’s vNodes (tokens) to the remaining disks on the host, in an approximately balanced way. Writes of new or updated S3 object data that would have gone to the disabled disk will now start going to the other disks on the host instead. Note that the existing data on the disabled disk will not be moved; the migration of the tokens will only impact writes of new data.</li>

                    <p>When you subsequently re-enable or replace the disk, the tokens will automatically be moved back to the re-enabled or replacement disk.</p>

                    <li><b>Disable Disk But Do Not Move Tokens</b> — With this setting, if disk errors are detected the system will automatically unmount the disk and mark it as disabled. However, the disk’s tokens will not be transferred to other disks on the node. Consequently while the disk is disabled the host will no longer be able to support S3 object data writes to the token ranges associated with the disabled disk.</li>

                <div class="Indent">
                    <p>This option may be acceptable if you expect to always be able to promptly replace any failed disks.</p>

                <p>Your configured automatic disk failure action will also be triggered if the HyperStore drive audit feature detects that a disk is in a read-only condition.</p>
