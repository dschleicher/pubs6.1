        <p>The settings in this section of the CMC’s <b><a href="../../../Resources/Images/cmc/cluster/ConfigurationSettings.png" target="_popup">Configuration Settings</a></b> page configure the HyperStore system’s functionality for tracking service usage by users and groups. After making any edits, click <b>Save</b> at the bottom of the page to dynamically apply the configuration change to the cluster.</p>

                <p>Whether to have the system maintain counts for number of HTTP requests, number of bytes-in, and number of bytes-out for each user and for each user group. By default this functionality is disabled, and the system only tracks and reports on stored bytes and stored object counts per user and group.</p>
                <p>You must change this setting to "Enabled" if you want the system to support usage reports that report on number of HTTP requests (GETs, PUTs, and DELETEs), bytes-in (upload) volume, and bytes-out (download) volume per user and group. This is important if you want to bill or charge-back users or groups based in part on request volume and/or data transfer volume.</p>
                <p>Note that enabling this feature does not produce request counts and data transfer counts for user activity that occurred during the period when the feature was disabled. Rather, if you enable this feature then request tracking and data transfer tracking starts from that point forward.</p>
                <p>Default = Disabled</p>
