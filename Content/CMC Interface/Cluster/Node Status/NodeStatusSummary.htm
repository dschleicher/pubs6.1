        <p>The upper part of the CMC's <a href="../../../Resources/Images/cmc/cluster/NodeStatus.png" target="_popup">Node Status</a> page provides a dashboard view of the health and performance of an individual node within your HyperStore system. A drop-down list lets you choose a node for which to display information.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/cmc/cluster/NodeStatus_general.png" class="ImgCloudian" />
        </p>
        <p>For the selected node, the <b>Node Status</b> page displays current information for the status and performance items described below.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note &#160;&lt;/b&gt;">The <b>Node Status</b> page — and the status and performance information displayed on the page — automatically refreshes once each minute.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Disk Used %</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>On the node, the percentage of total data disk capacity that is currently used. In the circle icon that graphically shows disk usage percentage, the disk used portion of the circle displays in <span style="color: #32cd32;">green</span> if disk usage is less than 70%; in <span style="color: #ffd700;">yellow</span> if usage is between 70% and 89%; or in <span style="color: #ff4500;">red</span> if usage is 90% or higher.</p>
                <p>Only disks that store HyperStore data directories (as configured by the <MadCap:xref href="../../../System Configuration/Configuration Files/CommonCsv.htm#hyperstore_data_directory" target="_popup">hyperstore_data_directory</MadCap:xref> setting in the <em>common.csv</em> file) or the Cassandra data directory (as configured by the <MadCap:xref href="../../../System Configuration/Configuration Files/CommonCsv.htm#cassandra_data_directory" target="_popup">cassandra_data_directory</MadCap:xref> setting in <em>common.csv</em>) count toward this stat. This stat does not count disks that are being used only for OS or application files, for example.</p>
                <p>This stat calculates disk usage in a way that counts a disk’s "reserved-blocks-percentage" (the portion of the disk space that’s reserved for privileged processes) as used space. Consequently this stat may show a higher disk usage value than would the Linux <em>df</em> command, which does not count reserved space towards a disk’s used space. By default in Linux systems the configurable "reserved-blocks-percentage" for a file system is 5% of disk capacity. In a HyperStore Appliance it’s set to 0.</p>
