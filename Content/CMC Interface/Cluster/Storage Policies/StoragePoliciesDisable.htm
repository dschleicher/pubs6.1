        <h1>Disable a Storage Policy</h1>
        <p class="TopicTag" MadCap:conditions="Cloudian.HelpSysAdminOnly">[CMC Interface]</p>
        <p>Disabling a storage policy prevents users from choosing the policy when they create new buckets. However, buckets that are already using the policy will continue to do so even after the policy is disabled.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note &#160;&lt;/b&gt;">You cannot disable the default storage policy. If you want to disable that policy you must first promote a different policy to be the new default.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note &#160;&lt;/b&gt;">Disabled policies still count toward the configurable limit on the number of polices that can exist in the system.</p>
        <p>To disable a policy, select the checkbox to the left of the policy name and then click <b>Disable</b>. The interface will ask you to confirm that you want to take this action.</p>
        <p>If subsequently you want to re-enable a disabled storage policy, select the policy and click <b>Enable</b>. When you re-enable a storage policy, the policy once again becomes available for service users to assign to newly created buckets.</p>
