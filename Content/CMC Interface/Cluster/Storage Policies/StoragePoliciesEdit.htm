        <p class="TopicTag" MadCap:conditions="Cloudian.HelpSysAdminOnly">[CMC Interface]</p>
        <p>To edit an existing storage policy, in the policy list on the CMC's <b><a href="../../../Resources/Images/cmc/cluster/StoragePolicies.png" target="_popup">Storage Policies</a></b> page click <b>View/Edit</b> for the policy that you want to edit. You cannot edit a policy’s data distribute scheme (such as replication factor or EC "k"+"m" values) or its data center assignment. You can edit the policy name, its description, its data consistency requirements, or its group visibility. For guidance on working with these policy characteristics, see <MadCap:xref href="StoragePoliciesAdd.htm">Add a Storage Policy</MadCap:xref>.</p>
