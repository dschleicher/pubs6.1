        <h1>Cloudian Management Console (CMC)</h1>
        <p>The Cloudian Management Console (CMC) is a web-based user interface for Cloudian HyperStore system administrators, group administrators, and end users. The functionality available through the CMC depends on the user type associated with a user’s login ID (system admin, group admin, or regular user). System admins can perform a wide range of system maintenance and operational tasks as well as provisioning and managing user accounts. Group admins can perform a much more limited range of tasks, pertaining specifically to their group. Regular users can use the CMC to create storage buckets and upload or download data.</p>
        <p>Just as the CMC's functionality is tailored to the logged-in user type, so too is the CMC's online help:&#160;users can only view the Help topics for the functionality that is available to them based on their user type.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note &#160;&lt;/b&gt;">The CMC has been tested most extensively with the Firefox browser. It is recommended that you use a recent version of Firefox when accessing the Console. Internet Explorer is not supported — you may experience display problems with some CMC pages if you use IE. There are no known problems with using Chrome to access the CMC, but Chrome support has not been thoroughly tested.</p>
