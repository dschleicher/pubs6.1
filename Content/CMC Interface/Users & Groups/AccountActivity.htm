        <p>Supported task:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Generate a billable activity report for a specified user</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note &#160;&lt;/b&gt;">For an overview of HyperStore user billing functionality, see <MadCap:xref href="../../Major Features/Billing/BillingOverview.htm" target="_popup">Billing Feature Overview</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>To generate a billable activity report for a user:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose a "Group Name" from the drop-down list and enter a "User ID" for the user.</li>
            <li>Choose a "Time Period" from the drop-down list. The billing periods are calendar months. You can only create a bill for a past, completed month; you cannot create a bill for the current, in-progress month. The default is the most recent completed month.</li>
            <li>Choose a "Region" from the drop-down list. Bills are calculated per service region. The CMC does not currently support multi-region aggregate bill generation.</li>
            <li>Choose a "Traffic Type" from the drop-down list. The options are "Normal" or "Whitelist". "Whitelist" refers to request traffic that originates from white-listed source IP addresses (traffic subject to special pricing), and is only an option if white-listing is enabled in the system. "Normal" refers to all other traffic.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Display Report</b> to display activity and charges for the selected billing period.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The image below shows a sample report. The upper part displays summary report parameters including the name of the rating plan that has been applied to the user’s activity. The lower middle shows the charging rules from the rating plan (in this case, a three-tier charging structure for price per GB-month, based on the average level of storage volume used), and the lower right shows the user’s usage level for the month (in this case 108 GB-months) and the resulting charges.</p>
