        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note &#160;&lt;/b&gt;">You cannot delete a group that currently has users in it. You must delete the users first, one by one (the CMC does not currently support bulk deletion of users). After deleting all the users you can delete the group.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Use the CMC's  <b>Manage Groups</b> page to <MadCap:xref href="ManageGroupsRetrieve.htm" target="_popup">Retrieve a Group of a List of Groups (CMC)</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>In the "Actions" column for the group that you want to delete, click <b>Delete</b>.</li>
            <li>When prompted by the system, confirm that you want to delete the group.</li>
