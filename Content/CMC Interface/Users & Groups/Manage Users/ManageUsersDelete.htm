        <p>You can delete a HyperStore service user from the system. If you delete a user, <b>their data is deleted from storage</b>. If you want to temporarily deny service access to a user without deleting their stored objects, don’t delete the user. Instead, <a href="ManageUsersEdit.htm" target="_popup">suspend the user</a>.</p>
        <p>To delete a user:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Use the CMC's <b>Manage Users</b> page to <MadCap:xref href="ManageUsersRetrieve.htm" target="_popup">Retrieve a User or List of Users</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>In the "Actions" column for the user that you want to delete, click <b>Delete</b>.</li>
            <li>When prompted by the system, confirm that you want to delete the user.</li>
        </ol>
