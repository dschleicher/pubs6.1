        <h1>hsstool opstatus</h1>
        <p class="TopicTag" MadCap:conditions="General.Online">[Command]</p>
        <p>This <MadCap:xref href="hsstoolOverview.htm" target="_popup">hsstool </MadCap:xref> command returns the status of the most recent runs of repair and cleanup operations that have been performed on a specified node. It also returns the status of any decommission operations. For repairs, the <em>opstatus</em> command reports the status of "proactive" repairs, repairs that have been triggered by the scheduled auto-repair feature, and any repairs that you have triggered manually by using <em>hsstool</em>.</p>
        <p>For each operation type:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If a run of the operation is <b>in progress</b> on the node, then that’s the run for which status is returned.</li>
            <li>If the operation is not currently in progress on the node, then status is returned for the <b>most recent</b> run of that operation on the node. This is only for operations that have been performed since the last start-up of the HyperStore service on the target node.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On the command line <em>opstatus</em> also supports an option to return a history of repairs performed on the target node. By default this history spans the past 90 days.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note &#160;&lt;/b&gt;">For background information on repair types see <MadCap:xref href="../../Major Features/Automatic Data Repair/DataRepairOverview.htm" target="_popup">Automatic Data Repair Feature Overview</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note &#160;&lt;/b&gt;">The <em>opstatus</em> command does not report on the status of "hinted hand-off" operations. For that, see the <MadCap:xref href="hsstoolHintsstatus.htm">hsstool hintsstatus</MadCap:xref> command.</p>

                        <p>For "decommission" operations, <em>opstatus</em> can only report in-progress status, not final, completed status. This is because the HyperStore service on the decommissioned node is immediately stopped at the completion of the <em>decommission</em> operation.

The repair operation will encompass not only the token ranges assigned to the target repair node but also certain token ranges on other nodes in the cluster. These are token ranges in which are stored replicas of the same objects that are on the target repair node. As a simplified example, if objects residing in token range "c to d" on the target repair node are also replicated in ranges "d to e" and "e to f" on other nodes in the cluster, then ranges "d to e" and "e to f" will be among the ranges repaired by the repair operation.

As a second example, if a 50000 byte object exists on the target node, and replicas of that object are supposed to exist on two other nodes but are found to be missing, and the repair streams the good object replica from the target repair node into the two other nodes — that counts as 100000 toward "total bytes streamed".</p>
