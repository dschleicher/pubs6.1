        <h1>HyperStore Installation</h1>
        <p>This documentation is for Cloudian HyperStore<sup>R</sup> version 6.0. For more information about the 6.0 release, see <MadCap:xref href="../Introduction/WhatsNew.htm">What's New</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>The main part of this documentation describes how to do a <b>fresh installation</b> of Cloudian HyperStore 6.0.</p>
        <p>If you are <b>upgrading to 6.0 from version 5.2 or later</b>, you can go directly to <MadCap:xref href="Upgrade.htm">Upgrading to HyperStore 6.0 From Version 5.2 or Later</MadCap:xref>. If you want to upgrade to 6.0 from a version older than 5.2, please contact Cloudian Support for instructions specific to your particular upgrade path.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note &#160;&lt;/b&gt;">If you do not yet have the HyperStore 6.0 package, you can obtain it from the Cloudian FTP site <em>ftp.cloudian.com</em>. You will need a login ID and password (available from <em>support@cloudian.com</em>). Once logged into the FTP site, change into the <em>Cloudian_HyperStore</em> directory and then into the <em>cloudian-6.0</em> sub-directory. From here you can download either:<br /><br />* The 6.0 HyperStore appliance ISO file <em>CloudianHyperStore-6.0-CentOS-6.7-x86_64-Install.iso</em>.<br />* The 6.0 HyperStore software-only release package <em>CloudianHyperStore-6.0.bin</em>.<br /><br />Beneath the <em>cloudian-6.0</em> sub-directory, product documentation is available under the <em>/doc</em> sub-directory — either as a set of HTML documents, or as a tarball or zip package of those same documents. The same documents are also bundled inside the ISO download and inside the software-only package download.<br /><br />To install and run HyperStore software you need a HyperStore <b>license file</b> — either an evaluation license or a production license. If you do not have a license file you can obtain one through Cloudian Support (<em>support@cloudian.com</em>) or from your Cloudian sales representative. If you are using the appliance ISO, the ISO package includes a very low-capacity license that can be used temporarily for verifying the functionality of your HyperStore system after installation, if you haven’t yet obtained an evaluation or production license.</p>
