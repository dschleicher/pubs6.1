                <p>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its</p>
                <p>distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must</p>
                <p>include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained</p>

                <p>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed</p>
                <p>as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or</p>
                <p>documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,</p>
                <p>within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and</p>

                <p>that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed</p>
                <p>as modifying the License.</p>
                <p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and</p>
                <p>may provide additional or different license terms and conditions</p>
                <p>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or</p>
                <p>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,</p>
                <p>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with</p>
                <p>the conditions stated in this License.</p>
                <p>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,</p>
                <p>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work</p>
                <p>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of</p>
                <p>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.</p>

                <p>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed</p>
                <p>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
                <p>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade</p>
                <p>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,</p>
                <p>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the</p>
                <p>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>
                <p>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or</p>
                <p>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each</p>
                <p>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,</p>
                <p>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or</p>
                <p>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions</p>
                <p>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A</p>
                <p>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the</p>
                <p>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any</p>
                <p>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>
                <p>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,</p>
                <p>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,</p>
                <p>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</p>
                <p>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be</p>
                <p>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,</p>
                <p>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a</p>
                <p>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the</p>
                <p>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,</p>
                <p>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all</p>
                <p>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor</p>
                <p>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
                <p>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</p>
                <p>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</p>
                <p>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</p>
                <p>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</p>
                <p>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</p>
                <p>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</p>
                <p>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</p>
                <p>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</p>
                <p>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</p>
                <p>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

                <p>3.1. Availability of Source Code.</p>
                <p>Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form</p>
                <p>must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed</p>
                <p>only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy</p>
                <p>of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available.</p>
                <p>You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can</p>
                <p>obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium</p>
                <p>customarily used for software exchange.</p>
                <p>3.2. Modifications.</p>
                <p>The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this</p>
                <p>License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or</p>
                <p>You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.</p>
                <p>3.3. Required Notices.</p>
                <p>You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor</p>
                <p>of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices</p>
                <p>contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving</p>
                <p>attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.</p>
                <p>3.4. Application of Additional Terms.</p>
                <p>You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters</p>
                <p>or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients’ rights hereunder. You</p>
                <p>may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations</p>
                <p>to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf,</p>
                <p>and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear</p>
                <p>that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and</p>
                <p>You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred</p>
                <p>by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability</p>
                <p>terms You offer.</p>
                <p>3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.</p>
                <p>You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or</p>
                <p>under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, p</p>
                <p>rovided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable</p>
                <p>form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient’s rights in the Source Code form from the rights</p>
                <p>set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different</p>
                <p>license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered</p>
                <p>by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial</p>
                <p>Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor</p>
                <p>as a result of any such terms You offer.</p>
                <p>3.6. Larger Works.</p>
                <p>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms</p>
                <p>of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure</p>
                <p>the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.</p>
                <p>4. Versions of the License.</p>
                <p>4.1. New Versions.</p>
                <p>Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License</p>
                <p>from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided</p>
                <p>in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.</p>
                <p>4.2. Effect of New Versions.</p>
                <p>You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under</p>
                <p>the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software.</p>
                <p>If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed</p>
                <p>or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make</p>
                <p>the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You</p>
                <p>originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or</p>
                <p>otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the</p>
                <p>License published by the license steward.</p>
                <p>4.3. Modified Versions.</p>
                <p>When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software,</p>
                <p>You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and</p>
                <p>remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license</p>
                <p>differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms</p>
                <p>which differ from this License.</p>
                <p>5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</p>
                <p>COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY</p>
                <p>KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED</p>
                <p>SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE</p>
                <p>ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY</p>
                <p>COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER</p>
                <p>CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER</p>
                <p>OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS</p>
                <p>AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.</p>
                <p>6. TERMINATION.</p>
                <p>6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail</p>
                <p>to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware</p>
                <p>of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the</p>
                <p>termination of this License shall survive.</p>
                <p>6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions)</p>
                <p>against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against</p>
                <p>whom You assert such claim is referred to as “Participant”) alleging that the Participant S</p>
                <p>oftware (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the</p>
                <p>Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly</p>
                <p>infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by</p>
                <p>such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant)</p>
                <p>and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days</p>
                <p>notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of</p>
                <p>such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim</p>
                <p>with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally</p>
                <p>or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.</p>
                <p>6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that the</p>
                <p>Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is</p>
                <p>resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement</p>
                <p>litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under</p>
                <p>Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any</p>
                <p>payment or license.</p>
                <p>6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses</p>
                <p>that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination</p>
                <p>(excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.</p>
                <p>7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</p>
                <p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),</p>
                <p>CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY</p>
                <p>DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY</p>
                <p>PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER</p>
                <p>INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER</p>
                <p>FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH</p>
                <p>PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF</p>
                <p>LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH</p>
                <p>PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME</p>
                <p>JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL</p>
                <p>DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
                <p>8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</p>
                <p>The Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101</p>
                <p>(Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” (as that term is defined at</p>
                <p>48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer software documentation” as such</p>
                <p>terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48</p>
                <p>C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire</p>
                <p>Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights</p>
                <p>clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision</p>
                <p>that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.</p>
                <p>9. MISCELLANEOUS.</p>
                <p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any</p>
                <p>provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed</p>
                <p>only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by</p>
                <p>the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software</p>
                <p>(except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such</p>
                <p>jurisdiction’s conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License</p>
                <p>shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and</p>
                <p>venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party</p>
                <p>responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys’</p>
                <p>fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the</p>
                <p>International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides</p>
                <p>that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply</p>
                <p>to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United</p>
                <p>States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of</p>
                <p>any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered</p>
                <p>Software.</p>
                <p>10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</p>
                <p>As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims</p>
                <p>and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under</p>
                <p>this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute</p>
                <p>such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be</p>
                <p>deemed to constitute any admission of liability.</p>
                <p>NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)</p>
                <p>The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of California</p>
                <p>(excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License shall</p>
                <p>be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of</p>
                <p>California and the state courts of the State of California, with venue lying in</p>
                <p>Santa Clara County, California.</p>

                <p>dedicates whatever copyright the dedicators holds in the work of</p>
                <p>authorship identified below (the "Work") to the public domain. A</p>
                <p>certifier, moreover, dedicates any copyright interest he may have in the</p>
                <p>associated work, and for these purposes, is described as a "dedicator"</p>
                <p>below.</p>
                <p>A certifier has taken reasonable steps to verify the copyright status of</p>
                <p>this work. Certifier recognizes that his good faith efforts may not</p>
                <p>shield him from liability if in fact the work certified is not in the</p>

                <p>Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and</p>
                <p>to the detriment of the Dedicator's heirs and successors. Dedicator</p>
                <p>intends this dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity</p>
                <p>of all present and future rights under copyright law, whether vested or</p>
                <p>contingent, in the Work. Dedicator understands that such relinquishment of</p>
