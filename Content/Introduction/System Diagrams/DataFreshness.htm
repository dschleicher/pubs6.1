        <h1>Data Freshness for Replicated Object Reads</h1>
        <p class="TopicTag" MadCap:conditions="General.Online">[Diagram]</p>
        <p>Typically all the replicas of a given object, and all the replicas of that object’s metadata, will be consistent — that is, all the replicas will be equally current. However, because HyperStore allows you to configure storage policies that utilize eventual consistency for writes, there may be times when an object’s data replicas and/or metadata replicas are temporarily inconsistent. If a read request on the object comes into the system during such a time, HyperStore either returns the freshest data or — if no fresh replica is available — fails the request.</p>
        <p>Consider a 3X replication scenario where QUORUM has been used for object data write CL and also for object metadata write CL. Suppose an S3 PUT of an updated version of an object has succeeded even though only two of three object data replica writes and only two of three object metadata replica writes succeeded. We then can temporarily have a condition like that shown in the following diagram, where "T2" indicates the timestamp of the new version of the data and metadata and "T1" indicates the outdated version. (For example, perhaps <em>node5</em> was momentarily offline when the S3 write request came in; and now it’s back online but hinted handoff and/or proactive repair have not yet completed.)</p>

        </p>
        <p>If an S3 read request on the object comes into the system during this temporary period of data inconsistency, the system works as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Because the CL for object metadata reads is always at least QUORUM (since only QUORUM or ALL are supported), the system will read at least two of the metadata replicas. Consequently it will read at least one of the fresh metadata replicas, with timestamp T2. If it reads one T1 metadata replica and one T2 metadata replica, it works with the metadata that has the freshest timestamp. The system then tries to retrieve an object data replica that has this same fresh timestamp.</li>
            <li>If an object data replica with the fresh timestamp is available, that object data is returned to the S3 client. If nodes are down in such a way that the only available object data replica is the outdated one, then the system fails the S3 request.</li>
        </ul>
