        <h1>Services Distribution -- 3 Nodes, Single DC</h1>
        <p class="TopicTag" MadCap:conditions="General.Online">[Diagram]</p>
        <p>Proper distribution of HyperStore service components across multiple physical nodes is handled automatically by the HyperStore installer. The diagram below shows a typical HyperStore services distribution in a three-node cluster within a single data center (DC). Things to note:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>On every node in your cluster are the S3 Service, Admin Service, HyperStore Service, Cassandra, CMC, Puppet Agent, and Monitoring Agent. These collectively are labeled as "COMMON SERVICES" in the diagram.</li>
            <li>For each specialized service that has a primary instance and a backup instance (such as Puppet Master or Redis Monitor), the backup resides on a different node than the primary. Likewise the Redis QoS slave will reside on a different node than the Redis QoS master, and the two Redis Credentials slaves will reside on different nodes than the Redis Credentials master.</li>
            <li>If you have a larger cluster in a single DC, you will still have the same number of specialized service instances as shown in the diagram (for example, one primary Cronjob instance and one backup instance) — the only difference is that this fixed set of specialized service instances will be spread across your cluster rather than concentrated among three nodes as shown in the diagram.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note &#160;&lt;/b&gt;">For information about the exact location of services in your HyperStore system, log into the CMC and go to the <MadCap:xref href="../../CMC Interface/Cluster/Cluster Information/ClusterInformationOverview.htm">Cluster Information</MadCap:xref> page.<br /><br />The system allows you to move services from one host to another, if you wish to do so. For instructions see <MadCap:xref href="../../Operations/Change Node Role/ChangeNodeRoleOverview.htm">Change Node Role Assignments</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note &#160;&lt;/b&gt;">If you have a very large cluster (25 nodes or more in a data center), consult with Cloudian Support about whether you should add more Redis Credentials slaves. For instructions on adding Credentials slaves, see <MadCap:xref href="../../Operations/Change Node Role/MoveRedisCredentialsSlave.htm">Move or Add a Redis Credentials Slave</MadCap:xref>.</p>
