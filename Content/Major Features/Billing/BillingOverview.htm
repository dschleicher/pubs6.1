        <h1>Billing Feature Overview</h1>
        <p>The HyperStore system maintains comprehensive <a href="../Usage Reporting/UsageOverview.htm">service usage data</a> for each group and each user in the system. This usage data, which is <a href="../Usage Reporting/UsageReplication.htm">protected by replication</a>, serves as the foundation for HyperStore service billing functionality.</p>
        <p>The system provides you the ability to create rating plans that specify charges for the various types of service usage activity, and to assign each user a rating plan. You can then generate bills for each user, for a selected service period. The CMC has a function for displaying a simple bill report in a browser, but in the more typical use case you will use the HyperStore Admin API to generate billing data that can be ingested a third party billing application.</p>
        <p>Cloudian HyperStore also allows for special treatment of designated source IP addresses, so that the billing mechanism does not apply any data transfer charges for data coming from or going to these "whitelisted" domains.</p>
