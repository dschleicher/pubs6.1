        <h1>Enabling Usage Tracking for Traffic</h1>
        <p>By default the only service usage data that the HyperStore system tracks is Storage Bytes and Storage Objects for each user and each group. If you want the system to also track HTTP Requests, Bytes IN, and Bytes OUT for each user and group, log into the CMC and go to <b>Cluster → Cluster Config → Configuration Settings</b>, and then open the <b>Usage Tracking</b> panel. There, enable the "Track/Report Usage for Request Rates and Data Transfer Rates" setting and <b>Save</b> your change. Your change is applied to the system dynamically -- there is no need to restart services.</p>
        <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note &#160;&lt;/b&gt;">You need to enable usage tracking for HTTP Requests and Bytes IN/OUT if you want to do either of the following:<br /><br />* Generate service usage reports for HTTP Requests, Bytes IN, and/or Bytes OUT.<br />* Base billing (in part) on HTTP Requests, Bytes IN, and/or Bytes OUT.</p>
