        <h1>Doing a Simple HTTP Responsiveness Check</h1>
        <p>The HyperStore system supports a health check that lets you quickly determine whether certain HTTP interfaces are responsive on particular hosts. This function is supported only for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>S3 Service (port 80 by default)</li>
            <li>HyperStore Service (port 19090 by default)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This function is not supported for HTTPS ports. </p>
        <p>To do the health check on a particular host, submit an HTTP HEAD request to <em>&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/.healthCheck</em>. If the service is up and running and listening on its assigned HTTP port, you will receive back an HTTP 200 OK status. If not, your request will time out.</p>
        <p>The example below shows a health check of an S3 Service instance that is responsive.</p><pre xml:space="preserve">HEAD http://192.168.2.16:80/.healthCheck
Status Code: 200 OK
