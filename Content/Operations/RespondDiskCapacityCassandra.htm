        <h1>Responding to a Cassandra Drive Nearing Capacity</h1>
        <p>If a Cassandra data drive (a disk or SSD storing the Cassandra database) is nearing capacity, the first two things to try are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use <MadCap:xref href="../Commands/hsstool/hsstoolCleanup.htm" target="_popup">hsstool cleanup</MadCap:xref> on the host node, using the <em>allkeyspaces</em> option. This will clear any Cassandra data that is no longer supposed to be on the node.</li>
            <li>Selectively delete Cassandra data. To do this, consult with Cloudian Support.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If these measures do not free up sufficient space, the solution is to increase system capacity by adding one or more new nodes. For the procedure see <MadCap:xref href="AddNode.htm">Adding a Node</MadCap:xref>. When you add a node, a portion of the Cassandra data on your existing nodes is copied to the new node and then deleted from the existing nodes — thereby freeing up space on the existing nodes.</p>
