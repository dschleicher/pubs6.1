        <h1>General Guidance on Developing S3 Client Applications for HyperStore</h1>
        <p>In nearly every way, developing a client application for the Cloudian HyperStore storage service is the same as developing a client application for Amazon S3. Consequently, when designing and building S3 applications for the HyperStore service you can leverage the wealth of resources available to Amazon S3 developers.</p>
        <p>The best place to turn for resources for developing Amazon S3 and Cloudian HyperStore S3 applications is the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank">Amazon S3 web site</a>. Through that site, Amazon Web Services (AWS) Developer Centers are available for a variety of development technologies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/java/" target="_blank">AWS Java Developer Center</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/net/" target="_blank">AWS Windows/.NET Developer Center</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/php/" target="_blank">AWS PHP Developer Center</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/python/" target="_blank">AWS Python Developer Center</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ruby/" target="_blank">AWS Ruby Developer Center</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>AWS Developer Centers include SDKs, community libraries, "Getting Started" guides, and tips and tricks.</p>
        <p>Another good Amazon resource is the archive of <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/search?searchQuery=amazon+s3&amp;searchPath=articles&amp;x=0&amp;y=0#facet_oc_amzn_products=Amazon+S3&amp;page=1" target="_blank">Articles &amp; Tutorials relating to S3</a>.</p>
        <p>Yet another helpful Amazon resource is the archive of <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/search?searchQuery=s3&amp;searchPath=code&amp;x=0&amp;y=0#facet_oc_amzn_products=Amazon+S3&amp;page=1" target="_blank">Sample Code &amp; Libraries relating to S3</a>.</p>
        <h2>What’s Distinct About Developing for the HyperStore Service</h2>
        <p>In practice, the main differences between developing for developing for the Cloudian HyperStore service and developing for Amazon S3 are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>As detailed in this documentation, the HyperStore service supports the great majority of but not the entire Amazon S3 API.</li>
            <li>Also as detailed in this documentation, the HyperStore service supports a small number of extensions to the Amazon S3 API.</li>
            <li>HyperStore client applications must use the Cloudian HyperStore service endpoint rather than the Amazon S3 service endpoint.</li>
            <li>You will need to use either the Cloudian Management Console (CMC) or the Cloudian HyperStore Admin API to create and manage service user accounts.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Maximum Objects Per S3 Bucket</h2>
        <p>In the Cassandra column family CLOUDIAN_METADATA, the HyperStore system stores S3 object metadata. In this column family there is one row for each S3 bucket. In each row there is one column for each object in the bucket.</p>
        <p>This object metadata storage architecture has implications for S3 bucket capacity and client application design:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Because Cassandra has a maximum of two billion columns per row, the HyperStore system has a maximum of two billion S3 objects per bucket.</li>
            <li>Rather than pushing the limits of capacity for a single bucket, which may negatively impact system performance, it’s best to create multiple buckets and spread S3 object uploads across the multiple buckets.</li>
        </ul>
