        <h1>HyperStore Support for the Amazon S3 API</h1>
        <p>The Cloudian HyperStore system supports the great majority of the Amazon S3 REST API, including advanced features.</p>
        <p>This documentation provides the details of the HyperStore system’s compliance with the S3 REST API. The organization of this documentation parallels that of the Amazon S3 API Reference. Links are provided to specific parts of the Amazon S3 API Reference so you can easily view additional information about individual API operations.</p>
        <p>This document takes the approach of specifying in detail the things that the HyperStore system <b>does support</b> from the Amazon S3 REST API — from service, bucket, and object operations, down to the level of particular request parameters, request headers, request elements, response headers, response elements, and special errors. <b>If it’s not listed in this HyperStore S3 API Support documentation, the HyperStore system does not currently support it</b>.</p>
        <p>This document also describes ways in which the HyperStore system extends the Amazon S3 API, to support additional functionality. These extensions are in the form of additional request parameters or request headers that add enhanced functionality to standard Amazon S3 operations on buckets or objects. These extensions are described within the sections that document HyperStore compliance with standard Amazon S3 operations. The extensions are always identified by a sub-heading that says <b>HyperStore Extension to the S3 API</b>.</p>
