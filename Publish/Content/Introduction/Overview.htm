            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>Cloudian HyperStore is a multi-tenant object storage system that fully supports the Amazon Simple Storage System (S3) API. The HyperStore system enables any service provider or enterprise to deploy an S3-compliant multi-tenant storage cloud.</p>
            <p>The HyperStore system is designed specifically to meet the demands of high volume, multi-tenant data storage:</p>
            <ul>
                <li value="1"><b>Amazon S3 API compliance</b>. The HyperStore system is fully compatible with Amazon S3â€™s HTTP REST API. Customers' existing HTTP S3 applications will work with the HyperStore service, and existing S3 development tools and libraries can be used for building HyperStore client applications. </li>
                <li value="2"><b>Secure multi-tenancy</b>. The HyperStore system provides the capability to securely have multiple users reside on a single, shared infrastructure. Data for each user is logically separated from other users' data and cannot be accessed by any other user unless access permission is explicitly granted.</li>
                <li value="3"><b>Group support</b>. An enterprise or work group can share a single HyperStore account. Each group member can have dedicated storage space, and the group can be managed by a designated group administrator.</li>
                <li value="4"><b>Quality of service controls</b>. HyperStore system administrators can set storage quotas and usage rate limits on a per-group and per-user basis. Group administrators can set quotas and rate controls for individual members of the group.</li>
                <li value="5"><b>Access control rights</b>. Read and write access controls are supported at per-bucket and per-object granularity. Objects can also be exposed via public URLs for regular web access, subject to configurable expiration periods.</li>
                <li value="6"><b>Reporting and billing</b>. The HyperStore system supports usage reporting on a system-wide, group-wide, or individual user basis. Billing of groups or users can be based on storage quotas and usage rates (such as bytes in and bytes out).</li>
                <li value="7"><b>Horizontal scalability</b>. Running on commodity off-the-shelf hardware, a HyperStore system can scale up to thousands of nodes across multiple data centers, supporting millions of users and hundreds of petabytes of data. New nodes can be added without service interruption.</li>
                <li value="8"><b>High availability</b>. The HyperStore system has a fully distributed, peer-to-peer architecture, with no single point of failure. The system is resilient to network and node failures with no data loss due to the automatic replication and recovery processes inherent to the architecture. A HyperStore cluster can be deployed across multiple data centers to provide redundacy and resilience in the event of a data center scale disaster.</li>
            </ul>
