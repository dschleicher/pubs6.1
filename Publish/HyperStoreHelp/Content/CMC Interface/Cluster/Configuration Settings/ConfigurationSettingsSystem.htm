                    <p>Supported options are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li value="1"><a href="http://google.github.io/snappy/" target="_blank">Snappy</a>

                    </ul>
                    <p>When enabled, compression is applied to incoming S3 objects by the S3 Service, before those objects are transmitted to the HyperStore Service and placed into storage. Any change that you make to the HyperStore Compression Type — such as changing it from disabled to a particular compression type, or from one compression type to another — is applied only to new S3 objects as they come into the system, not retroactively to objects that are already stored in the system.</p>
                    <p>Each object’s compression type (if any) is stored in the object’s metadata in Cassandra. Consequently, if for example you use Snappy for a while and then switch to LZ4, those objects that had been compressed with Snappy will continue to have in their metadata an indicator that they were compressed with Snappy — and so the system will be able to de-compress the objects when they are downloaded by S3 client applications.</p>

                    <p>Each node can locally store a maximum of this many bytes of hinted handoff data. If a coordinator node (a node processing an incoming S3 request) is unable to store a particular hinted handoff for an offline target node because doing so would exceed the coordinator node’s <em>HyperStore Max Hints Space Limit</em>, then:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li value="1">That particular hinted handoff is not created on the coordinator node.</li>
                        <li value="2">No further hinted handoffs are created for the offline node, by any of the other nodes in the cluster.</li>
                        <li value="3">When the offline node comes back online:<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li value="1">Hinted handoffs intended for the node are automatically processed.</li><li value="2">Proactive repair of the node is automatically performed, targeting the time period from when hinted handoffs stopped being created for the node up to the time that the node came back online.</li></ul></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Setting this to 0 has the effect of disabling hinted hand-off so that only proactive repair is used when a node has been down and then comes back online.</p>
