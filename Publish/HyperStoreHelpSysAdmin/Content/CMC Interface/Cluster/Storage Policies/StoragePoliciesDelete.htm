            <p class="Note" data-mc-autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note &#160;&lt;/b&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span><b>Note &#160;</b></span></span>In a HyperStore system that upgraded from a version earlier than 5.2, your legacy system storage configuration is codified as a storage policy named "DEFAULT_&lt;regionName&gt;". You cannot delete this policy. You can however disable it so that no new buckets use that policy. See <a href="StoragePoliciesDisable.htm" class="MCXref xref">Disable a Storage Policy</a>.</p>
            <p>Deleting a storage policy completely removes the policy from the system. You can only delete a policy <b>if no buckets are using the policy</b>.</p>
            <p>You cannot reconfigure buckets to use a different storage policy than they are currently using. Consequently, if any buckets are currently using a storage policy that you wish to delete, you must first delete all objects from those buckets, then delete the bucket themselves, and then you can delete the storage policy.</p>
            <p>To see which buckets (if any) are currently using a given storage policy, use the Admin API method <a href="../../../Admin API/Storage Policies/GetStoragePolicyUsage.htm" class="MCXref xref">GET Storage Policy Usage (Bucket List)</a>.</p>
            <p>If you are going to delete a policy that has ever been used by buckets, before deleting the policy retrieve the policy’s system-generated "policy-id" by using the Admin API method <a href="../../../Admin API/Storage Policies/GetStoragePolicyList.htm" class="MCXref xref">GET Storage Policy List</a>. You will need the "policy-id" in order to clean up residual data associated with the policy, as described in the Note further below.</p>
            <p>Once you’ve deleted any buckets associated with the policy, and obtained the policy’s policy-id (if the policy was ever used by buckets), you can delete the policy. </p>
            <p>To delete a policy, select the checkbox to the left of the policy name and then click <b>Delete</b>. The interface will ask you to confirm that you want to take this action.</p>
